# Brewards

**TL;DR**: A virtual punchcard reward app for regulars to keep track of beers drank and earn rewards for doing so.

### Description
Brewards is an app designed to provide incentives to regulars at breweries by keeping track of their virtual "punchcards". Once a user buys a beer from a brewery, a "punchcard" is set up for that user at that specific brewery. As a user continues to visit that brewery, they will eventually have accumulated enough "punches" for a free pint. After the user has completed a "punchcard", they will recieve a text notifying them that they have earned a free pint and is then redeemable at the brewery and a new "punchcard" is created.
